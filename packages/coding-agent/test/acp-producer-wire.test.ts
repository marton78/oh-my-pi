/**
 * Crosses the seam every other ACP test skips: the mapper suite fabricates
 * `details` by hand, so nothing there can ask whether a real producer actually
 * populates the field the mapper reads. Six review findings on
 * oh-my-pi/oh-my-pi#7078 lived in that gap (the spilled-artifact pointer, a
 * failing eval's status and exit code, …), each found by a reviewer rather
 * than by a test.
 *
 * So the coverage here is a matrix, not a case per bug: every ACP-relevant
 * producer outcome runs through its real tool (wrapped exactly as production
 * wraps it, `wrapToolWithMetaNotice`), into the mapper, in both capability
 * modes, and every case gets the same three generic assertions —
 *
 *   1. the frame's `status`/`terminal_exit.exit_code` match the outcome
 *      declared in the table (declared by hand from what the command did, so
 *      the assertion can't restate the mapper's own derivation);
 *   2. no fact the producer recorded structurally (`details.notices`,
 *      `details.notice`, `details.meta`'s rendered notice) is missing from the
 *      frame — the general form of the artifact-pointer loss, which no
 *      per-frame shape check could see;
 *   3. `checkAcpUpdateInvariants` passes, the same chokepoint check
 *      `AcpAgent#sendUpdate` runs.
 *
 * Adding a producer outcome is one table row, so the next producer with a
 * details-only fact is covered before a reviewer has to find it.

				// replay by construction; and a producer that destroyed part of
				// its own body before handing it over (`producerDroppedBytes`)
				// leaves nothing any channel could deliver — that loss is

/**
 * The failure mode this guards against: `producerFacts` declares three
 * axes (`details.notices`, `details.notice`, `details.meta`), but check #2
 * above is vacuous on any axis no row's *real* result populates — exactly
 * how `details.notice` shipped uncovered for the whole life of this matrix
 * (oh-my-pi/oh-my-pi#7078 review 4829715458): the axis was declared, the
 * check read it, and nothing ever failed because no row's producer ever set
 * it. Asserting non-vacuity here, once, is cheaper than re-discovering it
 * from a missed bug every time a new axis is declared.
 *
 * The top-level `errorMessage`/`message`/`text` (`directText`) axis is
 * deliberately not required here: within this matrix's scope (a single
 * `AgentTool.execute()` result), no producer sets it — the one real
 * instance, "Permission request cancelled", is synthesized a layer above
 * `tool.execute()` (the agent loop's permission-cancellation catch,
 * `cursor.ts`/`session-tools.ts`), never inside a tool result the matrix
 * can construct by calling a tool directly. That axis is covered instead by
 * `acp-event-mapper.test.ts`'s hand-fabricated fixtures, which is the
 * correct place for a framework-level fact no tool producer emits.
